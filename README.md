# pakiki-live-fire-range

This is the code for livefirerange.pakikiproxy.com. It contains a variety of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations for you to try and exploit.
It can be used to for learning about web application security, or to test security tooling. It doesn't attempt to replicate more comprehensive platforms for training or testing, like OWASP Juice Box, or OWASP Security Shepard. Instead we're focusing on the vulnerabilities which aren't present in those platforms or exposing them in ways that are better for testing PƒÅkiki Proxy.

**These examples are designed to expose vulnerabilities. They are not examples of good code, and should definitely not be used as examples of how to implement security features.**
